# 🌾 Yield Cycle

**Yield Cycle** is a web-based platform that connects farmers directly with factories, enabling transparent crop trading and eliminating middlemen. The platform helps farmers get fair prices for their produce while allowing factories to easily post crop requirements and source directly from producers.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Farmers often depend on middlemen to sell their crops, which leads to:
- Low profit margins for farmers  
- Lack of price transparency  
- Inefficient supply chains  

Factories, on the other hand, face difficulties in finding reliable and timely crop suppliers.

---

## 💡 Solution
Yield Cycle bridges the gap between farmers and factories by providing a direct digital platform where:
- Farmers can list their crops for sale  
- Factories can post their crop requirements  
- Both parties can interact without intermediaries  

This results in fair pricing, transparency, and improved supply chain efficiency.
